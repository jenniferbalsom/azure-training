## Azure Resource Manager template reference now available

We have published new documentation for creating Azure Resource Manager templates. The documentation includes reference content that presents the JSON syntax and property values you need when adding resources to your templates.

## Simplify template creation by copying JSON directly into your template

The template reference documentation helps you understand what resource types are available, and what values to use in your template. It includes the API version number to use for each resource type, and all the valid properties. You simply copy the provided JSON into the resources section of your template, and edit the values for your scenario.

## Please give us your feedback

The template reference content represents a new type of documentation for docs.microsoft.com. As you use the template reference to build your templates, let us know how it can be improved. Please provide feedback about your experience.
